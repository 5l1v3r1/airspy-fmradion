LMS convergence condition: 0 < mu < (2 / (N * (A^2)))
                           
where 
* N: filter order
* A: maximum amplitude aka complex abs for the signal
* alpha: step size
* mu: alpha / N

Therefore: A < sqrt(2 / alpha) when alpha is given

For example, if alpha = 0.1, A < sqrt(20), so A < 4.47

More conservative condition of LMS convergence: 0 < mu < (1 / (3 * tr[R]))
where tr[R] represents the total average input signal power,
also tr[R] = N * (A^2) [1]

Therefore: 0 < mu < (1 / (3 * (N * (A^2))))
which is equivalent to: 0 < alpha < (1 / (3 * (A^2)))
so the more conservative estimation is: : A < sqrt((1/3) * (1/alpha))

For example, if alpha = 0.1, A < sqrt(10/3), so A < 1.82
